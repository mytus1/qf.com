        Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
        <br />
        Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br />
        Because their words had forked no lightning they<br />
        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
        <br />
        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br />
        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br />
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
        <br />
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />
        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
        <br />
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br />
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br />
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
        <br />
        And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br />
        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />
        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
